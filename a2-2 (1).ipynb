Upload your `model.h5`file  from the previous notebook to Colab using the file browser (view -> table of contents, then click on the file icon).\n","\n","1. This notebook will convert it to TensorFlow.js format. You will see a new directory containing a `model.json` file (containing meta data), and one or more `group*.bin` files (containing the weights).\n","\n","1. Download these files to your local machine.\n","\n","1. Next, download the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxbc7IBo8AT8OGZqIe9LJQsqQyeOYPlF?usp=sharing) for your webpage (this is complete, and should work with your flowers model out of the box). There are three files you should download (index.html, index.js, and cat.jpg).\n","\n","1. Create a directory on your local machine (say, `tfjs`) and put all the files from the above two steps there.\n","\n","1. Next, you'll want to start a HTTP Server on your local machine (if you simply open index.html in a browser, you may run into security protections that prevent it from loading scripts. To start a server, you can use one built-in to Python. First, `cd` into your `tfds` directory.  \n","\n"," If you have Python2 installed, run this command in your terminal:\n","\n"," `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]`\n","\n"," If you have Python3:\n","\n"," `$ python3 -m http.server [port]`\n","\n","1. Now, open a browser (point the URL to `localhost:8888`). Your webpage should appear. If everything is working, you should see a cat picture with five confidence scores for the different classes. If not, to start debugging in Chrome, you can open the Javascript console via ```View - Developer -> Developer tools -> Console```. Check if there are any errors. \n","\n","1. (Optional). After you have gotten your model running in a browser locally, you may want to create a webpage. To do so, create a free [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) repo (or use your Columbia account), and upload these same files there. \n","\n","1. Take a screenshot of your finished model running in the browser and include it with your submission.\n","\n","References\n","* https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_keras\n","*
